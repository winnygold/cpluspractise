# Definitions : 

- Variable : A Variable is a object with name. Object is inturn a computer memory with type. 
We can also have objects without a name. Why Variable ?: When we supply name and type , it makes it easy for the compiler to generate machine code. 

```cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main()
{
    std::string pillow; // pillow is the name given to the variable
}

```
pillow is the name given to the variable. It is a local variable. As soon as the compiler is done executing the "}", it flushes the local variable and memory used by it.
